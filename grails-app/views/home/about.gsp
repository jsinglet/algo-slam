        <blockquote class="pull-right" style="width:400px">
  <p>The major cause [of the software crisis] is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem. In this sense the electronic industry has not solved a single problem, it has only created them, it has created the problem of using its products.</p>

        <p>AlgoSlam is the centralized environment you have been looking for. With AlgoSlam you can upload your program and compare it to your peers. And even if your program isnâ€™t he fastest, because you can view their source code, you can get a really good idea of how to improve your program next time.</p>
